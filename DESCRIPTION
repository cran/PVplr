Description: The pipeline contained in this package provides tools used in the
    Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension Center (SDLE) for the analysis of
    Performance Loss Rates (PLR) in real world photovoltaic systems. Functions
    included allow for data cleaning, feature correction, power predictive modeling, 
    PLR determination, and uncertainty bootstrapping through various methods 
    <doi:10.1109/PVSC40753.2019.8980928>.
    The vignette "Pipeline Walkthrough" gives
    an explicit run through of typical package usage.
